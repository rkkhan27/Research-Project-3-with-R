## The Effect of Court-Ordered Hiring Quotas on the Composition of Police

In McCrary’s 2007 AER paper, he argued that the series of
court-ordered racial hiring quotas imposed on municipal police
departments resulted inan increase of 14-percentage-points in the
fraction of African American new hires at these police departments. But,
the evidence on policeperformance after the change in the composition
of police, is mixed.

In this HW, we investigate the first research question, and analyze
the relationship between the court-orders and the percentage of AfricanAmerican police officers. Because the data for this AER paper is
confidential, this homework uses a simulated dataset prepared by an RA
for thisSignature Course (Xiaochen Sun). To simplify the settings from
the original paper, we set 1970 as the year for the court-order, and
provide twodata points for each city: 1960 and 1990. 1960 is the
“before” or “pre”
measure. 1990 is the “after” or “post” measure.
